# UPI-FRAUD-DETECTION

**Title :** Implementation of UPI Fraud Detection Project

**Overview:**
This commit introduces the foundational implementation of the UPI Fraud Detection Project. The code encompasses various stages, including data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation metrics computation.

**Key Features:**

**Data Acquisition:** Utilizes the Kaggle Python package to download the 'online-payment-fraud-detection' dataset.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducts EDA to understand dataset statistics, detect missing values, visualize feature distributions, and analyze correlation among features.

**Preprocessing:** Implements preprocessing steps such as categorical feature encoding using LabelEncoder and splitting data into training and testing sets.

**Model Development:** Constructs a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators to facilitate fraud detection within the UPI ecosystem.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's performance using various metrics including training and testing accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
